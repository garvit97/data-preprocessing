   Well, they've been incredible.  I've    never met anyone like you, actually.   
   Wow.  That IS good, isn't it?    
   Yes, it is.    
   It's very good.    
   Louise, I want to be honest.    
   In the past I've indulged    in destructive behaviour,   
   behaviour that I am not proud of.    
   But I'm in recovery now,     so for me every day is a blessing,    it really is.   
   I think maybe this is the right time    for me to open up, let someone in.   
  Thank you.    Louise,   
   I...used to...expose parts of my    naked body...   
   specifically my penis...    to young women.   
   Pardon?    
   I'm a flasher, Louise.     I'm a recovering flasher.   
   How young?    Never younger than 16.   
   Which is the age of consent,     so that's...   
   Do we get dessert with this?    
  This programme contains    strong language.   
   I just can't believe this,    this is amazing, you look great,    you really...  You look...   
   I thought you were in America?     I thought you'd moved to...   
   Look at you with your suit, and    I'm in a suit.  We're in a suit.   
   God, time.  It's mad, isn't it?    
   This is brilliant.     How's Damon, is he...?   We split up.   
   You split up?    
   But that's...  Oh, no, when?    
   God, but he was so good-looking,     and together you were just...   
   Well, we split up.  Seven years ago.    
   This is my house.    
   Well, it's not actually my house,     it's just a temporary, you know,    I'm in a transitional...   
   I mean, I live here, I do,     but I'm buying my own place, soon.   
   Probably, when I get the, er...    
  Well, y'know, my parents aren't    gonna live forever.   
   Not that I'm waiting for them to...     Let's go in.  Come in, come in.   
   So, here we are.    
   That's not staying.    
   We're getting rid of that,     that came with the...    And that phone's shit too.   
  The girls might be here.    They're a laugh, in a clever way.    Karen's a teacher.  And Louise...   
   She likes art and things.    
   We're quite cultured here,    
   like, uh, arts programmes,     Newsnight, 24, News 24.   
   Yeah, we're good mates,     I've got a lot of mates.  Come in.   
   RUNNING WATER   
   SLURRED:    Sorry, Donna.  S'all right.   
   S'OK.  I'm doing it into a glass.    
   Oh, shit.    
   Let's see if Karen's around.    
   He's, he's,     he's a lovely guy when he's...   
   He's with Karen.  She's helping him.    
   She's very, she's just like that.    
   CLINKING   
   SLURRED: I'm gonna batter this apple,     and then I'm gonna deep-fry it.   
   Right, this is...    I had some   chicken, but I'VE lost it...   
   Karen, this is Catherine.  Remember    I told you about my friend who,    er...?   
   Catherine, this is Catherine.    
   Catherine.    You wanna drink,    Catherine?   
   Erm, yeah, thank you.    
   You got any money?  Cos I'll pop down    the licence.  Actually, can YOU go?   
   I gotta keep an eye on this apple.    
   I mean, look at the state of this    place!  Why haven't we got nice  things?   
  Why haven't we got wallpaper,     not THAT wallpaper,   
   I mean proper wallpaper that    you actually choose and put up?   
   And why have we got that phone?    
   There are SO many phones, we could    have any one of a million phones,    and we have THAT phone.   
   This is about your mate    Catherine, isn't it?   
   You don't know about Catherine.     Catherine is...  Let me tell you   about Catherine.   
   In the mid-90s, if anything at    all happened in West Buntingford,    she was at the centre of it.   
   She was wearing long cardigan-coats    six months before anyone else was.    And yes, they became naff.   
   And yes, they became used    primarily to draw attention   away from a heavy lower half,   
   but this was before all that    happened.   What goes on in your head?   
   Karen, all I'm saying is that when I    bring someone like that to my home,   
   I would like to feel    like she might look at me and think,    "Yeah, Donna's done well."  
   But you haven't.    
  That's not the point.    I'd better go.    I've gotta try and find a way to get   into the office.   
   Don't you own the company, Billy?     Haven't you got keys?   Yeah, I have,    but they changed the locks.   
   To keep me out.    We make more money that way.   
  We've a load of phones at work.     I'll bring you one in if you like,    they're nice ones.   
  Thanks, Billy, but it's not about    the phone...  What kind of phones?   
   Blue ones.     Yeah, well, you may as well.   Yeah.   
   Aren't you going into work today?     I can't go in.  Look at the state   of me.   
   They're six-year-olds, Donna, I'd    scare the living shit out of them.    Can you hear yourself, Karen?   
   Look, I really like Billy.  I think    he's a lovely guy, but he's a MESS!   
   And he makes you worse.    
   You two should not be together,     it's like Oliver Reed and  Judy Finnegan.  It's just wrong.   
   Morning.     How did the big date go,   then?   
   Please tell me you at least    got yourself a handful.   
   You are so crude.  Mike's not    like that, he's a lovely man.   
   It's just that we really talk and    he's so honest and revealing, and...   
   really honest.    
   I just don't want to rush him.     God.  It sounds serious.   
   Yeah.  I think it is.  I mean, he's    been through a lot so he's not   had a relationship for a long time,   
   because, well, you know,     he's been hurt in the past,   
   and legally speaking he has to    report any contact with women   to his parole officer, so...   
  What?     Yeah, well, he used to be a sort of   sex offender, but nothing serious.   
  What?    Louise!   What sort of sex offender?   
   Oh, just flashing, girls.     In the park.  But not KIDS.   
   Adults.  Just young adult women.     He's a flasher?   
   Don't judge him.  Society does that.    
   Correctly.  He's a fucking flasher!    
   He WAS a fucking flasher.     He's in recovery.   
   It's in the past, and who are we    to point the finger at others?   
   We're people who don't show    our genitals to other people!   
   Do NOT compare me    having a laugh on a Friday night,    with some dirty park ranger.   
   Don't call him a dirty park ranger!    
   He's a good man.  He knows he's made    mistakes in the past.  Why can't we   give people a second chance?   
   We're not saying don't give people    a second chance.  Don't give FLASHERS   a second chance!   
   Oh, that's brilliant.     What kind of society would that be?   
   That's not the kind of world    I want to live in.   
   Yes, he's made mistakes.    
   And no, they're not "cool" mistakes    like drugs or armed robbery.   
   They're dirty mistakes,     but they're mistakes nonetheless.   
   All I'm asking    is that you give him a chance.   
   Bit of a dog, is he?    
   Never SEEN a good-looking flasher.    
   Shall I pick the meat off    another scotch egg for you?   
   No, five's my limit.    
   I've always loved the park.    
   I sort of see it    as my spiritual home.   
   GIRLS LAUGH   
   So when am I gonna see the girls?    What?   
   Your flatmates sound great.     I can't wait to meet them.   
   Oh, yeah, well, they can't wait   to meet you as well.   
  This is great.  Six months ago    I would have felt compelled  to show her my penis.   
   But now, here I am sitting here like    a normal person.  It's so positive.   
   I feel so...    
   Kiss me!    
   It's so good that I can be so    honest with you.  I never feel like   I have to censor my thoughts.   
   You could censor them a little bit.    
   No!    
   My therapist says that it's only    by being upfront and confronting  the past  
  that we lay the groundwork   for a future.  A future with you.   
   Catherine?    
   Oh, hi, Donna.  I've just ordered.     Do you want something?   Oh, yeah,    I'll have a latte.   
   God, how are you...?     And a latte, please.   
   Have you been waiting...?    
   You look...  Cardigan.  I love that,     that's...   
   Is it a cardigan?  Is it a coat?     How are you?   
   Shit.    
   Oh, well, that's...     Sorry to hear it.   
   Do you wanna sit down?     We can talk and...   
   Yeah.  We just gotta pay   for the coffee.   
   Oh, yeah, of course.     Â£1.55.   
   I've paid for mine, so...     Sure, sure.   
   Cheers for that, Karen.    
   Actually, do you mind    if I hang on to this?  For fags?   
  What's happened to your money, Billy?    
   I've sorta had all me assets frozen.    
   Yeah, I know.  I think they    was worried I might abscond.   
   Or...spend it.    
  Who?  Why?    Ah, it doesn't matter.   
   Honestly, it's not a big deal.    
   All right, OK.  Now, it's no big deal    but this Argentinian girl  
   who was sort of working for me as    a cleaner and her passport was up,    yeah?   
   And, um, I don't really remember it   
   but I think...we...got married?    
  Well, anyway, she's divorcing me    now and taking me for every penny   I've got.   She's WHAT?   
  Well, I've been a bad husband,     what with drink and drugs and stuff.   
   But you married her   just to keep her in the country.   
   It's difficult to build    a defence around that.   
   And you're just    gonna let this happen?   
   No, no, it's all with my lawyers    and everything.  She'll probably   end up with no more than...   
   60 or 70% of my earnings.    
   And everything I own.    
   Actually, Karen...    
   Can we talk about something    else, cos I think I might...   
   you know...    
   cry...    
   Look, what are WE doing in a PUB    when you've got this going on?   
   Making it better.    Oh.   
   I'm going.    Yeah, you're right.    It's dead in 'ere, man.    No, not to another pub, Billy!   
   This has got to stop.  LOOK at us!    
   Hang on, look, you're right.     No, you are!   
   But don't just split us up like    that, we don't have to do that,    cos I need you.   
   Look, we'll finish our drinks,     and then we'll sort this shit out.    But let's do it together.   
   Please?    
   And then I joined the Krishnas   for two years, which was awful.   
   But it kept me away   from thinking about suicide.   
  Then I met Adrian, who I hate.    
   We were only together for two weeks    when Troy was conceived.   
   So we stayed together for three    years, and just when I got the   courage to leave him,   
   I fell pregnant with Liam.    
   Two years later Adrian left me for    his cousin.  They've split up, so...   
   Are those desert boots?    
   Yeah.    Are they coming back?   
  What are you talking about, Donna?    
   No, er sorry nothing.    
   Well, you've got kids.  That's...    that's great.   
   Sometimes    I look at them and I think,    "You've taken everything from me."  
   So, er, so at least you got away    from Adrian.   
   Yeah, but now we've    got back together.    For the kids?   
   No.  Just not to be lonely.    
   It's great to see    one of the old gang doing well.   
   Who?    
   Oh, me?     You haven't...compromised, Donna.   
   You're living the life    we all hoped we'd live.   
  The dream.    
   Am I?     I mean, I am, not "Am I?"!   
   I am, yeah.  Yeah, it's great.    
   SLURRED:    I can't seem to...   
   I can't...    
   Karen, can I just pop it in soft?    
   No, you fucking can't!     Oh, hang on, hang on...   
   I thing I'm getting something.    
   SHE GURGLES   
   Ah, shit!    
   Hang on, hang on...    
   Ohh!  Wassa fuckin'...    
   This has never happened to me    before.   
   SLURRED:    I can only offer you   my sincerest apo...  Hang on,   
   hang on...    Shall we get a pizza?   
   Oh!  See, if I can just    get the TOP in...   
   AARGH! Jesus Christ!    Louise, it's me!   
   No, I know who it is, I thought you    were...   What?   
   No, no, look, sorry.     It's just the way you stepped out.   
   No, you see I thought...    
   I was gonna flash you?    No, no, no!   
   I didn't think...  God, no.    
   And look, even if you were...     I wasn't.   No, I know.  But even if...    I wasn't.   
   What I'm saying is,     I'm your girlfriend.   
   If you can't flash me,     who can you flash?   
   Mike?    
   I just feel, if I haven't got your    trust, then whose trust have I got?   
   I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Mike.  It was   just a shock.    I just wanna be normal.   
   But what's normal about exposing    yourself in front of young women?    You ARE normal.   
   That's all over with.     We can forget all that.   
  The thing is, Louise,     it becomes a downward spiral.   
   You just feel worse and you think,     "The only possible way I can ever  feel better about myself  
   "is to pull myself off    in front of a stranger."   
  Well, that's in the past.     We can forget all that, Mike.   
   When it's not enough,     you experiment.   
  We can forget all that, Mike.    What   happens if I use a rubber glove?   
   Or if I write "Mum"     on my stomach in lipstick?   
  What happens    if I put butter on my balls?   
   Mike, we really can forget all that!    
   You think I'm a freak.  And you're    right.  I'm never gonna fit in.   
   You ARE gonna fit in.    
   You are a good man.    
   And I tell you what, you're coming    round to my house tomorrow night.   
   You're gonna have dinner,     you're gonna meet my friends,    and they're gonna love you.   
   And your evil curse.    
   It's like time can be so powerful,     it can take a person.   
   I mean, you think you know someone    and you see that same person  11, 12 years later and they're...   
   Time's taken them away.     I mean, where to?   
  Who knows.  It was like    her entire personality had...died.   
   In what way?    
   She was wearing exactly the same    things she was wearing 12 years ago.   
   But in what way    had her personality died?   
   Right, well...    
   She was wearing stripy trousers,     a cardigan coat, desert boots.   
   What difference does it make    what she was wearing?   No, no,    it's not about the clothes.   
   The clothes are a metaphor,     they're a symbol.   
   I'm talking about a more    profound change, how someone   can just switch off to LIFE.   
   I could've sworn I saw a bandana    in her pocket.   
   Donna thinks her friend's rubbish    cos of her clothes.    Because of   her CLOTHES?   
   I don't think she's rubbish, I just    think she's become a bit rubbish.   
   Donna, that is the shallowest   thing I've ever heard.   It's not   shallow, I'm just saying...   
   Look,    the clothes are a metaphor, OK?   
   It's not about the clothes,     it's about, well, wearing shit   clothes, yeah.   
   But what I'm saying, right, OK,     what I'm saying is,   
   her SOUL was wearing shit clothes,     yeah, that's it.  Her soul was stuck   in the 90s.   
   And these days, with H&amp;M,     there's just no need for that.   
   How's it going with the flasher?     His name's Mike.   
   All right,     how's it going with Mike the flasher?   
   Don't call him that, I like him.     How can you like someone who   exposes themselves?   
   Well, I don't judge people    on their clothes.   
   He doesn't WEAR any clothes.    
   Don't talk like that.     He's coming round tonight.  He hasn't   got his confidence back yet.   
  Well, he should just go out    and subjugate a few more women, then.   
   Please don't tell him that    I've told you about this.   
   He's nervous enough as it is.    
   Oh, God, Catherine's coming round   tonight.   Why are you inviting  this girl if you don't like her?   
   Who says I don't like her?     She's still Catherine.   
   She's just a bit...  Look, Karen,     she thinks I'm brilliant, OK?   
   And I don't want to rub her face    in it but I want her to go away   thinking, "Yeah, Donna's brilliant.   
   "More brilliant than me,     even though I started out   more brilliant than her.   
   "She's more brilliant than me now.    
   "I'm just crap."    That's great, she can meet him.   
   I'll cook for her too.  Are you    and Billy on solids tonight?   
   There is no Billy.  I've had enough.     I'm kicking him out.  He's upstairs,    packing.   
   So you've finally seen sense?    Yeah.    I just think he's irresponsible.   
   Karen!  Karen!  She's going home.     We put the shits right up her!  She   thought we was trying to kill her.   
   She's going back to Argentina!    
   And it's all thanks to you!    
   Mwah!  I tell ya, if she hadn't    suggested burning her house down...   
   CAT MIAOWS   What?   
   I couldn't say no to him,     could I?    I'm really worried   about this evening.   
   What are you talking about?     He loves cooking.   
   It keeps him away from the booze.     Right, girls, it's all figured out.   
  We're gonna be starting off    with whelks in Drambuie,   
  followed by seared breast of chicken    in a white wine sauce, with new   potatoes and Sambuca legumes.   
   I'm thinking about doing    vodka mushrooms.  What do you think?   
   Fucking hell, Billy!    What's for dessert?   
   Cocaine trifle?    
   And then I went travelling, which    was, oh, incredible, incredible.   
   I went to Paris, Brussels, then back   to Paris.  It's amazing what you can   pack into two weeks.   
   Yeah, I just think it's important    to, er...   
  to expand your mind and your    horizons, which is why I've got   all those books.   
   SHE SIGHS    Do you read, or watch...DVDs?    No.   
  What's Adrian doing tonight?    
  Watching porn.    
   Right.  God.    I don't mind.   
   Keeps him away from ME.    Well,    every cloud has a...creamy lining!   
   I'm joking, I'm joking!    
   Do you know any jokes?    
   FOOTSTEPS    Here's Karen.   
  Who's put all these poxy books here?    
   CLINKING    Billy's making a sauce.   
   Billy...is cooking.  He's Karen's    sort of friend-boyfriend-partner.   
  That's the way things are here,     we don't have boundaries and   definitions.   
   DRUNKENLY: Stop talking shit.     Karen!   Great, Louise!   
   Oh, great...  This must be Mike?     Hello.   
   Oh, great, Mike.     I've heard so much about you.   
   Right.  Well, you must have heard   that I'm a convicted sex offender,    then?   No.   
   Well, I am.     I'm in recovery now, but I used to   expose my genitals to women.  Sorry.   
   This must be...Karen?    
   INTENSE WHISPERED EXCHANGE   
   Karen, I'm Mike.    
   You may as well know I'm a    convicted sex offender and I used   to expose my genitals to women.   
  What do you want, a fugging medal?     This must be Catherine?   
   Oh, I think it's time for dinner.     Is that...?  I think that's   Sambuca legumes I'm smelling.   
   Look, I hope this doesn't    make you all feel awkward,    it's just these days  
   I think it's best to be upfront.    
   Part of my behavioural problems    in the past have stemmed from my   inability to be honest about myself.   
   Show us yer cock.     Well, well, Karen, there was a time.   
   Karen!     No, it's fine, Karen's  just having a joke.  And it IS funny.   
   It's a ridiculous thing    I used to feel the need to...   
   Get yer knob out.     That's what I'm saying.   
   Once upon a time I would've,     and that's the problem.  But now,    with therapy, I'm moving...   
   Show us it, then.    
   ..away from the stigma of...    This is great, isn't it?    ..showing my penis to women.   
   HE LAUGHS MANIACALLY   
  These sorts of debates, that's just    what we're like here.  I mean,    we get all sorts dropping round...   
   Free thinkers, gangsters, tinkers...    
  What's the matter?  You don't like it    when a woman asks you?  Does that   intimidate you?   
   Karen, you're drunk.    At least   I'm not a dirty park ranger.   
   OK, yes, I did do things,     that's right.  But I am trying  to move on from that.   
   I'm not proud of what I've done.    
   I'm not proud    of exposing my genitals.   
   Can you stop talking about it,    then?   
   Sorry?    Just stop going on about it!   
   I mean, is it always going to be    like this?   
   If I introduce you to my parents,     do you tell THEM?   
  Would you tell my old schoolteacher,     Mrs Reedy?   
   Would you tell Mrs Reedy?     What if you met a celebrity?    Would you tell them?   
   Sir Paul McCartney?  Would you tell    Sir Paul McCartney?   
   Wassa matter?  Mummy not give you    enough huggy-wuggy?   
   Don't talk to him like that!    No.   
   No, Louise, let Karen say what she    wants to say.  She has that right.   
   Yes, Karen, I have got a past.    
   A bad past.  And I am not proud    of what I've done.  Not proud at all.   
   But I AM trying   to move on from that.   
   I'm trying to make my life    so that I am no longer a danger   to myself or those around me.   
   I'm...  I'm just trying to live    a good life.   
   All I'm asking from you    is that you let me do that.   
   SOBBING   
   Come 'ere, man.    Aww!    Maybe we can move on from this now,   
   because, not that it hasn't been   fun, y'know, because it has, but...   
   If I had one fuckin' ounce    or micro-ounce of the strength  
   and the courage that you've got,     man, I would be king of the world!    Thank you.   
   Thanks for that.    
   You must be Billy.  I'm Mike.    
   I'm a convicted sex offender.    
  What?    
   CHAOTIC SCREAMING    Billy!   
   Well, that's everything.  We can talk    about this, Kal, can't we, you know?   
   We don't have to split up, do we?     I mean, maybe we can find a way   to...   
  Will you tell Louise I'm sorry    about her boyfriend's face?   
   And leg.    
  TAXI ENGINE IDLES   
   Don't go like this, Mike!     I think Billy made some trifle   for dessert, so...   
   No, look, he's going.  He won't    BE there.  You don't have to...   
   You think that's why I'm leaving?    
   All right, look, I admit it.     Yes, I find it a bit...   
   difficult when you talk about it.  But    maybe we can just not talk about it?   
   I thought you could accept my past.    
   I thought YOU were different.    I AM   different! Just not that different.   
   I'm gonna go, Louise.    
   Wouldn't want to embarrass you    if Sir Paul McCartney happens  to drop by.    Mike.   
  What is the matter with you?    
  Why do you ALWAYS have to do this?     I'm sick of it!   
  What is it about living here   that you can't have anything?   
   Are you happy now?  Are you happy   that he's gone?   
   I am happy that the flasher has left   the building, yes, Louise, I am.   
   He might have been a flasher,     but at least he was MY flasher.   
   Look, I'm sorry, Catherine.  I don't    know what I was trying to do here.   
   I was trying to impress you or    something, I suppose.  Who am I   trying to fool?   
   Christ, that's just pathetic!     I suppose I just wanted you  to think that...   
   What the fuck are you doing?!    
   I've never done it with a woman.    What?   It's one of the things I've   never done.   
   Never with a woman, and I thought,     you know, you lot seem up for   anything...   What?  No!  No way!   
   What are you talking about?    Jesus Christ!   
  What do you think this is,     some sort of sex colony?   
  There's so many things I haven't...     I haven't lived.   
   And I see you, and you're so cool    and happy and everything here   is so wonderful  
   and I've...had such a wonderful   time.    Really?   
   Yeah.    
   My life is SHIT.    
   Catherine, your life isn't shit, OK?    
   It's just...very disappointing.    
   You just gotta get out there,     y'know?  Do a course.  Join Kabbalah!   
   It'll happen for you, Catherine.    
  Just like it happened for me.    
   Yeah...maybe.    
   I'd better go.    
   You're doing really well, Donna.    
   I know.    
   No, not that.    Just shake hands, just...
