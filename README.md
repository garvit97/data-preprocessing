punc.py-
This code scans through the raw data ( input_file) and coverts it into an easy to use format (output_file) that can be directly used for pmi calculation.

To run the code, use the following command-  pmi punc.py <input_file> <output_file>


cleanout.py-
To run error_calculator.py from punc2, we need to first clean the desired output. cleanout.py is used to clean that output.


cleanweb.py-
To run error_calculator.py from punc2, we need to clean the output from the model on their website. cleanweb.py is used for this.

cleanforpunc2-
